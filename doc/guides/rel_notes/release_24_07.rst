DPDK Release 24.07
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     =======================================================

* **Enabled AF_XDP PMD multi interface (UDS) support with AF_XDP Device Plugin**.

  The EAL vdev argument for the AF_XDP PMD ``use_cni`` previously limited
  a pod to using only a single netdev/interface. The latest changes (adding
  the ``dp_path`` parameter) remove this limitation and maintain backward
  compatibility for any applications already using the ``use_cni`` vdev
  argument with the AF_XDP Device Plugin.

* **Integrated AF_XDP PMD with AF_XDP Device Plugin eBPF map pinning support**.

  The EAL vdev argument for the AF_XDP PMD ``use_map_pinning`` was added
  to allow Kubernetes Pods to use AF_XDP with DPDK, and run  with limited
  privileges, without having to do a full handshake over a Unix Domain
  Socket with the Device Plugin. This flag indicates that the AF_XDP PMD
  will be used in unprivileged mode and will obtain the XSKMAP FD by calling
  ``bpf_obj_get()`` for an xskmap pinned (by the AF_XDP DP) inside the
  container.

* **Updated Wangxun ngbe driver.**

  * Added SSE/NEON vector datapath.

* **Updated Wangxun txgbe driver.**

  * Added SSE/NEON vector datapath.
